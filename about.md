Hi!

My name is Edward Zhou, and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Science student at the University of British Columbia!

Previously, I worked at [SAP](http://go.sap.com/) as a Software Engineer intern.

Even more previously, I was an Android Developer intern at [Pantoscope Media](http://www.scopephotos.com/#/main).

Simply put, I'm a nerd that lifts, but if you'd like to know a little more about me, here are some little facts:
- I'm the oldest child in the family (in fact I'm 6 years older than my brother)
- My favourite deserts are egg tarts
- I love spicy food (challenge me, I'll accept it any day)
- I probably eat more than you (you can challenge me on this one too)
- I like hugs!

### And the obvious...
I love coding.
And hackathons.
And just about anything like meeting together with friends and hacking up something cool, so if that interests you too then feel free to hit me up with some ideas and I'd love to work on them with you!
